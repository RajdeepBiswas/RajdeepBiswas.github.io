Hiiii!! Glad to meet you virtually.  
Am a sports fanatic and love to write technical articles/blogs, organize meetups, speak about AI/ML, and publish reusable code. 

## Some more background...
Started working with distributed computing about 15 years ago with Apple iCloud reporting team.  
In my professional life have built multi petabyte greenfield and brownfield Hadoop, Spark and other MPP Data warehouse environments.  
Lead multiple Data science engagements from conception to production.  
Currently am a Director of Azure Data & AI in Microsoft, and my group focuses on the design and implementation of Big Data and Machine Learning problems.

Let us have the joy of learning together and looking forward to connecting with you.
