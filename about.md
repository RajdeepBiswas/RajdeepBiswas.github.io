Hiiii!! Glad to meet you virtually.  
Am a sports fanatic and love to write technical articles/blogs, organize meetups, speak about AI/ML, and publish reusable code. 

## A few more things about me
I started working with distributed computing and big data from some 15 years ago with Apple iCloud reporting team.  
During my journey have built multi petabyte scale greenfield/brownfield Hadoop, Spark and other MPP Data warehouse environments.  
Am engaged in multiple Data science initiatives from conception to production.  
Currently, I am a Director of Azure Data & AI in Microsoft, and my group focuses on the design and implementation of Big Data and Machine Learning problems.  

Let us have the joy of learning together and looking forward to connecting with you.
